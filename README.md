# 🚀 Houdini Menu Reference Repository

This repository is intended as a **reference collection of Houdini menu definitions**, showcasing how to structure and organize custom menus for different contexts inside Houdini.

It focuses on serveral menu integrations, serving as a clean example of how tools can be exposed consistently through Houdini’s XML-based menu system.



## 📦 Purpose of this repository

The main goal of this repository is **not to document individual tools**, but to provide:

* A clear reference for **custom Houdini menu layouts**
* Examples of **menu XML structure**
* Best practices for:
  * Menu hierarchy
  * Script bindings
  * Context separation
  * Pipeline-oriented organization

This makes it useful as a starting point for studios or TDs building their own Houdini tool menus.



## ✨ Features

* Clear menu hierarchy examples
* Multiple Houdini menu contexts
* Python-driven actions
* Pipeline-ready structure
* Easy to extend and customize



## 💡 Recommended usage

* Use this repository as:
  * A reference when building your own Houdini menus
  * A base template for studio tool integration
  * Documentation for menu architecture decisions
* Adapt naming, paths, and structure to match your pipeline needs



## ⚠️ Notes

* This repository is **reference-oriented**
* Tool implementations may evolve independently
* Menu definitions assume a Python-based Houdini pipeline
* Paths and module names should be adjusted per studio setup
